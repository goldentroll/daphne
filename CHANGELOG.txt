0.14.2 (2016-07-07)
-------------------

* Marked as incompatible with twisted 16.3 and above until we work out why
  it stops incoming websocket messages working


0.14.1 (2016-07-06)
-------------------

* Consumption of websocket.receive is also now required.


0.14.0 (2016-07-06)
-------------------

* Consumption of websocket.connect is now required (channels 0.16 enforces
  this); getting backpressure on it now results in the socket being
  force closed.


0.13.1 (2016-06-28)
-------------------

* Bad WebSocket handshakes now return 400 and an error messages
  rather than 500 with no content.


0.13.0 (2016-06-22)
-------------------

* Query strings are now sent as bytestrings and the application is responsible
  for decoding. Ensure you're running Channels 0.15 or higher.


0.12.2 (2016-06-21)
-------------------

* Plus signs in query string are now handled by Daphne, not Django-by-mistake.
  Ensure you're running Channels 0.14.3 or higher.

* New --root-path and DAPHNE_ROOT_PATH options for setting root path.


0.12.1 (2016-05-18)
-------------------

* Fixed bug where a non-ASCII byte in URL paths would crash the HTTP parser
  without a response; now returns 400, and hardening in place to catch most
  other errors and return a 500.

* WebSocket header format now matches HTTP header format and the ASGI spec.
  No update needed to channels library, but user code may need updating.


0.12.0 (2016-05-07)
-------------------

* Backpressure on http.request now causes incoming requests to drop with 503.
  Websockets will drop connection/disconnection messages/received frames if
  backpressure is encountered; options are coming soon to instead drop the
  connection if this happens.


0.11.4 (2016-05-04)
-------------------

* Don't try to send TCP host info in message for unix sockets


0.11.3 (2016-04-27)
-------------------

* Don't decode + as a space in URLs


0.11.2 (2016-04-27)
-------------------

* Correctly encode all path params for WebSockets


0.11.1 (2016-04-26)
-------------------

* Fix bugs with WebSocket path parsing under Python 2


0.11.0 (2016-04-26)
-------------------

* HTTP paths and query strings are now pre-decoded before going to ASGI


0.10.3 (2016-04-05)
-------------------

* Error on badly formatted websocket reply messages


0.10.2 (2016-04-03)
-------------------

* Access logging in NCSAish format now printed to stdout, configurable to
  another file using --access-log=filename


0.10.1 (2016-03-29)
-------------------

* WebSockets now close after they've been open for longer than the channel
  layer group expiry (86400 seconds by default for most layers).

* Binding to UNIX sockets is now possible (use the -u argument)

* WebSockets now send keepalive pings if they've had no data for a certain
  amount of time (20 seconds by default, set with --ping-interval)


0.10.0 (2016-03-21)
-------------------

* Multiple cookies are now set correctly

* Follows new ASGI single-response-channel spec for !

* Follows new ASGI header encoding spec for HTTP


0.9.3 (2016-03-08)
------------------

* WebSocket query strings are correctly encoded


0.9.2 (2016-03-02)
------------------

* HTTP requests now time out after a configurable amount of time and return 503
  (default is 2 minutes)


0.9.1 (2016-03-01)
------------------

* Main thread actually idles rather than sitting at 100%

* WebSocket packets have an "order" attribute attached

* WebSocket upgrade header detection is now case insensitive


0.9 (2016-02-21)
----------------

* Signal handlers can now be disabled if you want to run inside a thread
  (e.g. inside Django autoreloader)

* Logging hooks that can be used to allow calling code to show requests
  and other events.

* Headers are now transmitted for websocket.connect

* http.disconnect messages are now sent

* Request handling speed significantly improved
